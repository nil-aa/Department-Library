# Department Library Management System

A webâ€‘based application designed to digitize and streamline academic library operations within your IT department. Developed as part of UIT2402 â€“ Advanced Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis, this system leverages advanced data structures and secure web practices to enhance search performance, automate workflows, and improve user experience for both library staff and patrons.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Traditional departmental library systems often struggle with slow searches, manual recordâ€‘keeping, and limited user roles. This project solves those pain points by offering:

* **Fast, intelligent search** via a Trieâ€‘based autocomplete engine for instant suggestions.
* **Roleâ€‘based dashboards** for Admins and Students/Faculty, minimizing unauthorized access.
* **Endâ€‘toâ€‘end book management**: catalog CRUD, borrowing/return workflows, and realâ€‘time availability updates.
* **Automated notifications** for due dates and overdue items to reduce manual followâ€‘up.
* **Scalable, modular architecture** built on RESTful APIs and optimized database indexing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Features

### 1. Secure User Management

* **Role-Based Access Control**: Distinct **Admin** and **Student/Faculty** roles with permissions tailored to each group:

  * **Admins** can manage books, user accounts, and approve or reject borrow requests.
  * **Students/Faculty** can browse the catalog, submit borrow/return requests, and view personal history.
* **Authentication & Security**:

  * Passwords stored with industry-standard hashing (bcrypt).
  * Email verification workflow for new accounts.
  * Session management via secure cookies or JWT tokens with configurable expiration.

### 2. Advanced Search & Autocomplete

* **Trie Data Structure**:

  * Provides **O(L)** lookup time for prefix matches, where *L* is the query length.
  * Reduces memory overhead by sharing common prefixes across entries.
* **Dynamic Filtering & Sorting**:

  * Filter results by categories (e.g., Programming, Networking, Databases) and availability status.
  * Sort by relevance, title, author name, or date of entry.
* **Error Tolerance**:

  * Suggests closest matches for minor typos or incomplete queries.

### 3. Comprehensive Catalog Management

* **CRUD Operations**:

  * Add new books with metadata: title, author, ISBN, category, shelf number, and acquisition date.
  * Update book details or remove outdated entries.
* **Bulk Import/Export**:

  * CSV/Excel import for large datasets in one operation.
  * Export catalog snapshots for offline analysis.
* **Availability Tracking**:

  * Realâ€‘time status updates when books are borrowed or returned.
  * Automatic count of total and available copies.

### 4. Borrowing & History Tracking

* **Borrow/Return Workflow**:

  * Students submit requests through the interface.
  * Admins receive a dashboard notification and can approve or deny with optional notes.
* **Due Date Logic**:

  * Configurable loan periods (e.g., 14 days by default).
  * Automatic accrual of fines for overdue items, with rate and maximum caps.
* **Audit Trail**:

  * Complete transaction logs detailing timestamps, user IDs, and admin actions for compliance.

### 5. Notifications & Reminders

* **Email Alerts**:

  * Scheduled reminders sent 3 days before due date and on the morning of the due date.
  * Overdue notices dispatched daily until the book is returned.
* **Inâ€‘App Notifications**:

  * Dashboard banners highlight items nearing due dates or already overdue.
* **Custom Templates**:

  * Admins can modify email subject lines and message bodies without code changes.
